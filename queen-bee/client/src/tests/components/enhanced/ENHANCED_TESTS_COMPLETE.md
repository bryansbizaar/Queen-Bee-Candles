## 🔧 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Dependencies Installation
```bash
cd client

# Install enhanced testing dependencies
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/react jest-axe resize-observer-polyfill
```

### Phase 2: Configuration Updates
Update your `vitest.config.js` to include the enhanced test setup:

```javascript
// Add to vitest.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    setupFiles: [
      './src/tests/setup/enhancedTestSetup.js', // Add this line
      // ... existing setup files
    ],
    // ... rest of config
  }
})
```

### Phase 3: Package.json Scripts
Add enhanced test scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:enhanced": "vitest run src/tests/components/enhanced",
    "test:a11y": "vitest run --reporter=verbose src/tests/components/enhanced --grep=accessibility",
    "test:responsive": "vitest run --reporter=verbose src/tests/components/enhanced --grep=responsive",
    "test:all": "vitest run",
    "test:coverage-full": "vitest run --coverage"
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Run Enhanced Tests
```bash
# Run all enhanced component tests
npm run test:enhanced

# Run accessibility tests specifically
npm run test:a11y

# Run responsive design tests
npm run test:responsive

# Run complete test suite (cart + enhanced)
npm run test:all

# Generate comprehensive coverage report
npm run test:coverage-full
```
